						In this document, we present our observations of user behavior related to <strong>doomscrolling</strong> and outline a proposal to address and mitigate its effects. Through careful analysis of engagement patterns, cognitive tendencies, and emotional responses, we aim to identify key challenges users face when interacting with social media. The findings serve as the foundation for designing targeted strategies and solutions that promote mindful usage, reduce compulsive scrolling, and enhance overall digital well-being.
						</p>

						<h4 class="fw-bold mt-4 mb-3">Observing Users</h4>
						<p>
						During our observations, we identified how users engage in doomscrolling in their daily routines. In particular, we observed several individuals on the metro, both seated and standing, who spent the duration of their ride scrolling through social media on their phones. In most cases, the activity lasted for long periods of time, often more than 10 minutes of continuous scrolling without visible pauses. Many users only realized they had reached their stop, or briefly looked up, once the train arrived, showing how absorbed they were in their screens.

					<h2 class="mb-0">Identifying the Problem</h2>
					<p class ="lead"> The main interaction problem identified is the phenomenon of doomscrolling, defined as the compulsive and prolonged consumption of digital content, often emotionally charged, that traps users in a vicious cycle with little awareness of time or context. Our observations in both transit environments and relaxed spaces revealed that individuals frequently engage in continuous scrolling for extended periods. This behavior was characterized by minimal physical activity, selective engagement with content that maximized short-term gratification, and frequent redirection caused by notifications and app switching.
The issue lies in how current social media platforms are designed to encourage sustained attention, effectively capturing users in loops that are difficult to break. As a result, users lose situational awareness, such as missing their metro stop or ignoring their surroundings, and experience reduced control over their digital habits. Doomscrolling, therefore, represents not just an individual lapse in self-regulation but a systemic interaction problem rooted in persuasive interface design. Addressing this requires solutions that interrupt the cycle, promote mindful engagement, and help users regain agency over their screen time. Photographs below show users absorbed in their devices, ignoring their surroundings, exemplifying the interaction problem.

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p>
            To develop targeted user personas for our project, we adopted the task-based segmentation methodology. We began by compiling a list of distinguishing behaviors observed in users during doomscrolling, such as prolonged continuous browsing, frequent app switching triggered by notifications, selective engagement with emotionally appealing content, and a loss of situational awareness.

            <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">The Socially Immersed Student</h4>
            <p>
              This persona represents a typical student, aged 18–24, who spends much of their daily time on social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts. Observations show that they often scroll during commutes or while lounging in comfortable spaces, frequently losing track of time and situational awareness. Selective attention drives their behavior: they skip content they find boring or negative and linger on posts that bring short-term enjoyment. The project could help this persona by introducing tools that encourage mindful engagement, provide subtle reminders to pause, and promote awareness of online time.

            <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">The Overworked Professional</h4>
            <p>
              This group typically includes early-career professionals aged 25–35 who mainly use social media during work breaks or commutes to relieve stress. Observations reveal that they engage in prolonged passive scrolling, often switching between multiple apps, which reinforces a compulsive loop. Their challenges include diminished focus, anxiety, and guilt over lost time. Strategies to help them could include features like intentional usage prompts, screen-time tracking, and better notification management to help balance digital habits with professional responsibilities.
            </p>

            <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">The Socially Connected Teen</h4>
            <p>
              This group usually consists of teenagers aged 13 to 17 who spend significant time on social media apps. They scroll for long periods at home, in public, or during school breaks, often losing track of time. Frequent notifications and peer interactions trap them in a cycle of compulsive doomscrolling. They also face issues with self-image due to idealized content, poor sleep, and difficulty focusing. The project could support this persona by promoting mindful app use, managing notifications, providing gentle reminders to take breaks, and encouraging healthier social media engagement.

            <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">The Mindful-but-Vulnerable Adult</h4>
            <p>
              Our observations indicate that this group represents a mid-career adult aged 30–45 who attempts to consume social media meaningfully but occasionally falls into doomscrolling cycles, particularly when stressed or exposed to emotionally negative content. Research indicates that such users are susceptible to existential anxiety and pessimism, highlighting the psychological impact of prolonged engagement. This persona would benefit from design solutions that encourage mindfulness, limit exposure to emotionally harmful content, and introduce intentional breaks to regain control over their digital habits.

                <p class="lead">
                    We chose this persona because students aged 18–24 represent a demographic that frequently engages in prolonged social media usage, often losing track of time and situational awareness. Their scrolling habits highlight key challenges such as compulsive engagement and selective attention to emotionally appealing content. By focusing on this persona, we can design targeted strategies that encourage mindful use, provide subtle reminders to pause, and help them maintain awareness of their online time.

                <h3>Our Solution</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                    The proposed system is a software-based intervention designed for platforms that employ infinite scroll and algorithmic feeds, such as Instagram Reels and TikTok. Its purpose is to reduce doomscrolling without disrupting the initial user experience. At the start of a session, the feed remains unchanged to preserve usability and intended user experience. As time passes, the system introduces gradual interventions that encourage awareness: soft timers, and subtle animations and peripheral pop-ups that draw attention to elapsed time without interrupting the flow. With continued use, these cues escalate approaches by adding more frictions (discussed in the following sections) which requires the user to make a conscious decision and extra efforts to proceed. The approach avoids simple override mechanisms and instead, balances effort and reward, gradually reducing the immediate rewards of continued scrolling through heavier frictions. In layering these interventions gently and gradually, the goal is to support sustainable behavior change and healthier engagement patterns over the long term.

            App-limit functions integrated into operating systems such as iOS and Android allow users to set per-app or category time limits. Once the daily quota (e.g., 60 minutes for social media) is reached, the system displays a blocking overlay that requires manual override to continue use.

          <p class="mt-3">
            <strong>Commercial Brands:</strong> One Sec, ClearSpace, ScreenZen, Taskfulness, and Mindful: Focus<br><br>
            Third-party “friction” apps aim to delay or disrupt impulsive app opening rather than outright blocking. These apps insert an extra step whenever a designated distracting app is opened. They work through a combination of delay+prompt intercepts. The delay intercept works by showing a pop up screen with a timer countdown for a few seconds (also helpful for users who muscle-memory-open apps without intending to). Only after this brief mindfulness exercise will the app actually open. The prompt intercept works by prompting users to set an intended session length (e.g. 1, 5, or 10 minutes) for that app usage. When the chosen time is up, the app locks again and the friction process is repeated in order to continue.

          <p class="mt-3">
            <strong>Commercial Brands:</strong> #blockit, LeechBlock, StayFocusd<br><br>
            Browser plug-ins and web blockers modify or severely modify interface elements on desktop/web versions of social platforms. Typical configurations remove infinite-scroll feeds  and algorithmic hooks (Explore pages, suggested posts, Reels/Stories modules), or replace feeds entirely with phrases/quotes, and other less distracting elements. Some allow for time-limit setting, and once the limit is hit, the page is inaccessible. They can also enforce “focus mode” by blacklisting sites entirely for a period.  These blockers are more heavy-handed than friction apps  by making the distracting content completely unavailable.

          <h4 class="fw-bold text-center">Category D: Physical Hardware / Hardware “Locks”</h4>
          <p class="mt-3">
            <strong>Commercial Brands:</strong> Brick, Unpluq, Yondr Pouch, PhoneLocker<br><br>
            These are hardware interventions that introduce physical friction to app access. Brick and Upluq are very similar in mechanism, they both pair a smartphone app with a physical NFC/Bluetooth “key” tag designated distracting apps remain blocked by default and are only unlocked by physically tapping the tag. By requiring a physical device/tag within reach, and having no digital shortcut alternative, this creates a high barrier to app access.
Yondr Pouch/PhoneLocker alternatively, are lockable fabric enclosures used to create phone-free zones (e.g., classes, exams, events). A smartphone is sealed in the pouch with a magnetic lock similar to retail security tags; the device stays with the user but cannot be accessed until it is tapped on a venue “unlocking base” to open the pouch. This arrangement forces full device inaccessibility within the specific area.

          <p class="mt-3">
            <strong>Commercial Brands:</strong> Light Phone II, Punkt MP02, Mudita Pure<br><br>
           The minimalist phone approach replaces or supplements a smartphone with a device limited to core utilities (calls, SMS, basic tools such as alarm or simple maps) and no social media, app store, or full-feature browser. Another variant of this approach is configuring an existing smartphone to act like a dumbphone. Some enthusiasts install bare-bones launchers or custom operating systems that strip down smartphone capabilities (hiding all apps except essentials).  Others employ the “two-device” strategy, carry a basic phone for communication on the go, and use a secondary device for the smart features when needed.

    <h2 class="text-center mb-4 fw-bold">Key Distinctions: Our Approach vs Existing Solutions</h2>
    <p class="text-muted text-center mb-5">
      A few principal distinctions exist between the existing approaches and our proposed approach.
    </p>

    <div class="row justify-content-center">
      <div class="col-lg-10">
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush fs-5">
          <li class="list-group-item py-3">
            <strong>Preservation of User Experience (Initial Phase):</strong>  
            Our solution allows users to enjoy the original app interface and scrolling experience for a specified time window without disruption. Unlike external blockers or rigid devices (e.g., Yondr, Brick), the intervention does not immediately alter the experience or remove access.
          </li>

          <li class="list-group-item py-3">
            <strong>No Easy Loopholes:</strong>  
            Current built-in tools often provide bypasses (e.g., iOS “Ignore for Today”). Our approach deliberately avoids such one-time dismissals. If users want to continue beyond limits, they must engage in increasingly effortful interactions, ensuring reflection before continuation.
          </li>

          <li class="list-group-item py-3">
            <strong>Effort vs. Reward Balance:</strong>  
            Over time, the system gradually shifts the cost–benefit dynamic: scrolling requires more effort (through mild design frictions), while the perceptual and emotional reward decreases (through subtle dampening cues, such as fading colors or softened contrast). This makes prolonged doomscrolling less compelling without blunt lockouts.
          </li>

          <li class="list-group-item py-3">
            <strong>Sustainable Long-Term Use:</strong>  
            Many interventions (digital detoxes, hardware lockouts) rely on drastic short-term restrictions. Our solution is designed for sustainable, everyday integration, supporting healthier usage patterns that users can realistically maintain over weeks and months.
          </li>

          <li class="list-group-item py-3">
            <strong>Per-Session and Per-Day Limits:</strong>  
            The system accounts for both micro-sessions (e.g., a late-night scroll) and cumulative daily use. Users receive tailored nudges that respect context — encouraging shorter sessions and discouraging repeated return cycles throughout the day.
          </li>

          <li class="list-group-item py-3">
            <strong>Graduated, Calm Interventions:</strong>  
            Rather than sudden pop-ups or hard stops, our approach employs graduated cues such as color fading, decreasing brightness, escalating to gentle interactive pauses, and only introducing stronger frictions when necessary. This calm, layered progression differentiates it from all-or-nothing blockers.

  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="text-center mb-4 fw-bold">Illustrating a use-case scenario:</h2>
    <p class="fs-5">
      In this case, we present a combination of scenarios featuring the same persona, “The Socially Immersed Student,” to evaluate different design ideas for promoting mindful social media use. Each scenario explores how various calm technology interventions, such as peripheral color cues, subtle timers, and animations, can gently guide the user toward healthier scrolling habits in different contexts.
    </p>
    <p class="fs-5">
      Alex is in the campus lounge, scrolling through Instagram Reels. After 15 minutes, subtle cues appear: soft colored gradients emerge around the edges of his screen, and a small timer or clock is displayed in the periphery. Notifications remain unobtrusive, allowing him to continue scrolling if he chooses. Alex notices the peripheral color change, becoming subtly aware of his screen-time without being interrupted. Here, calm, visual cues are utilized to raise awareness without interrupting the flow of the user.
    </p>
    <p class="fs-5">
      During a long study session in the library, Alex has been scrolling for 30 minutes. The system introduces a more intrusive but still gentle checkpoint; the periphery of his screen gradually shifts in soft colors, and a pop-up in the middle of the screen provides a reminder of the duration of time spent on the app.  Alex notices the visual cue, becomes aware of the time he has spent away from his studying, and then decides whether to resume scrolling or get back to studying.
    </p>
    <p class="fs-5">
      Late at night in his dorm, Alex has been using social media for 45 minutes. The system gradually dims screen brightness/modifies pixel hues to indicate prolonged use without stopping his activity. Alex sees the change, reflects on his usage, and chooses to wrap up his session for the night.

        <h3>Designing at a High Level</h3>
        
        <p class="lead">
          The diagram above illustrates the architecture of the Doomscrolling Application Notification System, which helps users manage excessive screen time. The system runs on a mobile device and includes an App Usage Tracker that monitors how long the user spends on different apps. This data is sent to a Notification Scheduler for immediate feedback and also logged in a Usage Database for longer-term storage. An Analytics Engine processes the stored data to detect patterns and provides insights to optimize when and how notifications are delivered. The Notification Scheduler then sends push alerts to the user, encouraging breaks when extended usage is detected. This design combines real-time tracking, historical analysis, and personalized notifications to reduce doomscrolling behavior.

        <p class="lead">
          In the first sketch, four models are presented to promote more mindful and calm phone use while doomscrolling. The first model uses soft colors around the screen edges to subtly alert the user about their usage time. The second displays a small image or icon indicating the elapsed time. The third gradually dims the screen brightness to encourage a break, and the fourth features a character that pops up to notify the user when they have been using their device for too long.

          In the paper prototype, we explored different ways of representing time spent on apps. The first and second diagrams both use bar-like visual indicators to show the duration of usage for a particular app. The third diagram introduces an alternative approach, where the scrolling speed is deliberately slowed down, forcing users to become more aware of their engagement with the content. The fourth diagram utilizes decreasing brightness to create added friction.

          Paper prototype of Instagram UIs, with alongside solution UIs overlaid and time progression emphasized. The time progression is depicted in 15 minute intervals from 10:00 am to 10:45 am across four models. The first one shows an unchanged/regular Instagram UI at the beginning of the interaction. The second shows a timer icon pop up in the right upper corner (periphery visual cue) after 15 minutes. After 30 minutes, a lightning bolt takes up a larger space and pops up with a question “Continue?” with response choices ‘Yes’, ‘No’ and ‘Redirect’. Based on the choices, the system either continues background activities, terminates, or redirects to a different task. The fourth model depicts another peripheral notification saying “Black & white mode activated” where the screen gradually becomes monochrome.

        <h3>Justifying Feasibility</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          The core building blocks of our system—including <strong>app usage monitoring</strong>, <strong>notification scheduling</strong>, and a <strong>simple interactive UI</strong>—can be implemented using existing mobile APIs and lightweight frameworks. For example, iOS and Android both provide tools to track app usage duration, foreground activity, and notifications, which can be integrated seamlessly into our application.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          To support <strong>analytics and data visualization</strong>, a minimal backend can be set up using technologies such as <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>Firebase</strong>, or <strong>Node.js</strong>. This backend can collect usage data, perform basic analysis, and provide insights to optimize interventions without requiring heavy infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Our team has existing expertise in <strong>mobile development</strong>, <strong>backend integration</strong>, and <strong>UI/UX design</strong>, so no additional training is necessary. This allows us to focus on <strong>integration and testing</strong> of different design ideas with users, ensuring the interventions are effective and engaging.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          The estimated workload of <strong>20–30 hours per team member</strong> is realistic. Most of this time will be allocated to <strong>user testing</strong>, <strong>iterating prototypes</strong>, and <strong>fine-tuning notifications and visual cues</strong>. By leveraging existing APIs and libraries, we can efficiently build a functional system that is robust, user-friendly, and deliverable within the project timeline.
