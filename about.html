  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="text-start mb-4">Low Fidelity Prototype</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      We began the design process by creating 12 initial low-fidelity prototypes that explored various aspects of the app’s core features. These early prototypes allowed us to visualize how users might interact and benefit from different functionalities helping them avoid doomscrolling.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      After evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of these designs, we identified the most promising concepts and refined them further using the 10+10 ideation method. This helped us generate a diverse set of design alternatives while maintaining a focus on clarity and user experience.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      To make the concepts more engaging and relatable, we represented them through story-based sketches that depict potential user interactions. The initial collection consists of 12 prototype images expressing 10 distinct design ideas, each exploring a unique approach to mindful digital engagement.
    </p>
    <!-- Sketch 1 -->
    <div class="row mb-5 align-items-center">

      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 text-left">
        <h5>Sketch version 1</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          In the first sketch, four models are presented to promote more mindful and calm phone use while doomscrolling. The first model uses soft colors around the screen edges to subtly alert the user about their usage time. The second displays a small image or icon indicating the elapsed time. The third gradually dims the screen brightness to encourage a break, and the fourth features a character that pops up to notify the user when they have been using their device for too long.
        </p>
		
      </div>
    </div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 text-left">
        <h5>Sketch version 2</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          In the paper prototype, we explored different ways of representing time spent on apps. The first and second diagrams both use bar-like visual indicators to show the duration of usage for a particular app. The third diagram introduces an alternative approach, where the scrolling speed is deliberately slowed down, forcing users to become more aware of their engagement with the content. The fourth diagram utilizes decreasing brightness to create added friction.

        <h5>Sketch version 3</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          Paper prototype of Instagram UIs, with alongside solution UIs overlaid and time progression emphasized. The time progression is depicted in 15 minute intervals from 10:00 am to 10:45 am across four models. The first one shows an unchanged/regular Instagram UI at the beginning of the interaction. The second shows a timer icon pop up in the right upper corner (periphery visual cue) after 15 minutes. After 30 minutes, a lightning bolt takes up a larger space and pops up with a question “Continue?” with response choices ‘Yes’, ‘No’ and ‘Redirect’. Based on the choices, the system either continues background activities, terminates, or redirects to a different task. The fourth model depicts another peripheral notification saying “Black & white mode activated” where the screen gradually becomes monochrome.

<section id="feature-based-prototypes" class="py-5">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="text-start mb-4">Functionality-Based Prototypes</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      After developing our initial low-fidelity sketches, we moved on to create prototypes focused on three key features that we wanted to integrate into our app:
    </p>
    <ol class="lead">
      <li>Providing users with a sense of <strong>time</strong> and the <strong>amount of content consumed</strong>.</li>
      <li>Designing <strong>interventions</strong> to help users become aware of and regulate their scrolling behavior.</li>
      <li>Offering <strong>customizability</strong> so users can personalize their experience and control how these features appear.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="lead">
      Through this stage, we explored how different sections of the app would look and function with these new features enabled. We also designed visual mockups of how the social media platform (in this case, Instagram) would appear once these mindful interaction elements were applied. Each prototype highlights how these features can encourage more balanced engagement while maintaining the familiar experience of social media use.

    <p class="lead">
      The first five sketches illustrate the <strong>time-awareness functionality</strong>, exploring different visual approaches to help users understand how long they have been scrolling or how much content they’ve consumed. Each variation tests a distinct method for representing time — through subtle on-screen cues, edge color changes, visual timers, or animated indicators — allowing us to identify which format feels most natural and least intrusive to users.

      The second sketch illustrates the <strong>intervention functionality</strong>. The image shows four variations of interventions designed to subtly interrupt prolonged scrolling and encourage mindful breaks. Two main strategies are explored: one where the Instagram feed gradually turns <strong>monochrome</strong> after extended use, and another where the <strong>brightness of the feed is reduced</strong>. Each variation tests how visual cues and changes in display affect user awareness and promote calmer phone usage.

      The third sketch illustrates the <strong>scroll-slowdown functionality</strong>. After the user reaches a pre-set time limit for Instagram usage, the feed gradually slows down, making it harder to scroll quickly. This intervention encourages users to become more aware of their usage, reduces impulsive scrolling, and helps them take a mindful break without abruptly stopping their session.

The <strong>Home Page</strong> allows users to control the amount of time spent on each app. The <strong>Friends Page</strong> displays usage and compares it with friends. The <strong>Controls Page</strong> lets users enable or disable features such as <strong>monochrome mode</strong>, <strong>slow scroll</strong>, <strong>time display</strong>, and <strong>brightness control</strong> via toggle buttons. Finally, the <strong>Profile Page</strong> shows personal details and earned badges, offering a personalized experience.

        <h3>Observer Briefing for both prototypes</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          As an <strong>observer</strong>, your primary responsibility is to quietly watch how participants interact with the app designed to help reduce Instagram screen time. Avoid offering assistance, explanations, or suggestions unless the participant is completely unable to continue.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          During the session, pay close attention to:
          <ul>
            <li>How the participant navigates through the interface to explore features.</li>
            <li>The clarity and intuitiveness of the interface as users attempt to complete key actions like setting limits, reviewing progress, or customizing their experience.</li>
            <li>Visible signs of confusion, hesitation, or frustration, including pauses, repeated actions, or verbal expressions of difficulty, and how the participant chooses to respond to these situations.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Your goal is to gather detailed observations that shed light on the system’s <strong>ease of use, efficiency, engagement</strong>, and ability to handle errors. Specifically, record:
          <ul>
            <li>Any usability challenges the participant encounters.</li>
            <li>The approximate time taken to complete major tasks.</li>
            <li>Behavioral cues and feedback that reflect the participant’s comfort, satisfaction, or frustration.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Please remain neutral and unobtrusive throughout the process. The goal is to observe authentic user behavior and capture insights that will help evaluate the design’s effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.

        <h3>User Introduction for Both Prototypes</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Welcome, and thank you for taking part in our usability testing session. Today, you’ll be testing a low-fidelity prototype of an app designed to help users track and reduce their screen time on Instagram. Your participation will allow us to evaluate how intuitive, motivating, and user-friendly the system is.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          During this session, you’ll be asked to complete a series of short tasks within the app. These tasks include:
          <ul>
            <li>User Log In</li>
            <li>Explore the App</li>
            <li>Set Time Limits</li>
            <li>Enable an Intervention in Controls</li>
            <li>React to Contextual Events</li>
            <li>Check Time Usage</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          The user will not be asked to “Enable an Intervention in Controls” in prototype 2. There are no right or wrong answers or actions; we’re simply interested in understanding how you naturally interact with the app. Please speak your thoughts out loud as you perform each task, sharing anything that feels confusing, frustrating, or enjoyable. Your honest feedback is essential to improving the design and ensuring it effectively supports users in managing their screen time. The session should take around 20 minutes, followed by a short discussion about your experience.

        <h3>User Training Documentation</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Since the goal of this usability test is to evaluate how intuitive, learnable, and user-friendly the prototype design is, participants were not provided with any prior instructions, manuals, or demonstrations on how to use the app or its features. Given that participants already possess familiarity with Instagram and its interface, they were expected to rely on this prior experience to navigate and complete tasks within the prototype. Before starting the test, participants were only briefed on the specific benchmark tasks they were required to perform, such as viewing their screen-time statistics, setting time limits, enabling reminders, and customizing their experience, but no further operational details were shared. This approach ensures that user performance reflects the prototype’s natural ease of use and intuitiveness, allowing us to accurately assess how effectively the design supports users in managing and reducing their Instagram screen time without explicit instruction.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Test Tasks</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          The usability study focuses on evaluating how effectively the app supports users in tracking and managing their digital habits across multiple platforms. Participants will complete a series of tasks designed to explore the system’s main features, from basic navigation to setting limits and responding to interventions. Each task is designed to test different features of the system, capturing both the ease of use and the quality of insights gained.
        </p>

        <ol class="lead">
          <li>
            <strong>User Log In</strong><br>
            Participants log into the app using a username and password. This task ensures that users can access the system successfully and locate the main interface.
            <br><strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Open the app.</li>
              <li>Enter username and password.</li>

            <strong>Set Time Limits</strong><br>
            Participants set limits for daily usage to see how easily the app allows control over digital habits.
            <br><strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Navigate to the “Time Limits” section.</li>
              <li>Set daily or app-specific scrolling limits.</li>
              <li>Confirm that limits are saved correctly.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Enable an Intervention in Controls (Prototype 1 only)</strong><br>
            Participants test interventions designed to influence usage behavior. For this experiment, they will activate one intervention at a time.
            <br><strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Open the “Controls” window.</li>
              <li>Select a single intervention: Monochrome, Slow Scroll, Brightness, or Monitor Time.</li>
              <li>Verify that the selected intervention is active while others remain off.</li>
              <li>Observe the effect of the intervention on app usage.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>React to Contextual Events (Prototype 2 only)</strong><br>
            Participants experience dynamic changes in the app interface that simulate real-world interruptions.
            <br><strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>A clock reminds the user of elapsed time.</li>
              <li>Screen monochromy gradually decreases.</li>
              <li>Scrolling becomes slower or slightly laggy.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Check Time Usage</strong><br>
            Participants review daily app usage statistics to evaluate how clearly information is presented.
            <br><strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Access the “Dashboard” tab.</li>
              <li>Review total time spent and app-specific breakdown.</li>
              <li>Review past usage statistics and visualizations.</li>
