    <h2 class="text-start mb-4">Low Fidelity Prototype</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      We began the design process by creating 12 initial low-fidelity prototypes that explored various aspects of the app’s core features. These early prototypes allowed us to visualize how users might interact and benefit from different functionalities helping them avoid doomscrolling.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      After evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of these designs, we identified the most promising concepts and refined them further using the 10+10 ideation method. This helped us generate a diverse set of design alternatives while maintaining a focus on clarity and user experience.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      To make the concepts more engaging and relatable, we represented them through story-based sketches that depict potential user interactions. The initial collection consists of 12 prototype images expressing 10 distinct design ideas, each exploring a unique approach to mindful digital engagement.
    </p>
    <!-- Sketch 1 -->

        <h5>Sketch version 1</h5>
        <p class="lead">
          In the first sketch, four models are presented to promote more mindful and calm phone use while doomscrolling. The first model uses soft colors around the screen edges to subtly alert the user about their usage time. The second displays a small image or icon indicating the elapsed time. The third gradually dims the screen brightness to encourage a break, and the fourth features a character that pops up to notify the user when they have been using their device for too long.

        <p class="lead">
          In the paper prototype, we explored different ways of representing time spent on apps. The first and second diagrams both use bar-like visual indicators to show the duration of usage for a particular app. The third diagram introduces an alternative approach, where the scrolling speed is deliberately slowed down, forcing users to become more aware of their engagement with the content. The fourth diagram utilizes decreasing brightness to create added friction.

          Paper prototype of Instagram UIs, with alongside solution UIs overlaid and time progression emphasized. The time progression is depicted in 15 minute intervals from 10:00 am to 10:45 am across four models. The first one shows an unchanged/regular Instagram UI at the beginning of the interaction. The second shows a timer icon pop up in the right upper corner (periphery visual cue) after 15 minutes. After 30 minutes, a lightning bolt takes up a larger space and pops up with a question “Continue?” with response choices ‘Yes’, ‘No’ and ‘Redirect’. Based on the choices, the system either continues background activities, terminates, or redirects to a different task. The fourth model depicts another peripheral notification saying “Black & white mode activated” where the screen gradually becomes monochrome.

  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="text-start mb-4">Functionality-Based Prototypes</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      After developing our initial low-fidelity sketches, we moved on to create prototypes focused on three key features that we wanted to integrate into our app:
    </p>
    <ol class="lead">
      <li>Providing users with a sense of <strong>time</strong> and the <strong>amount of content consumed</strong>.</li>
      <li>Designing <strong>interventions</strong> to help users become aware of and regulate their scrolling behavior.</li>
      <li>Offering <strong>customizability</strong> so users can personalize their experience and control how these features appear.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="lead">
      Through this stage, we explored how different sections of the app would look and function with these new features enabled. We also designed visual mockups of how the social media platform (in this case, Instagram) would appear once these mindful interaction elements were applied. Each prototype highlights how these features can encourage more balanced engagement while maintaining the familiar experience of social media use.

      The first five sketches illustrate the <strong>time-awareness functionality</strong>, exploring different visual approaches to help users understand how long they have been scrolling or how much content they’ve consumed. Each variation tests a distinct method for representing time — through subtle on-screen cues, edge color changes, visual timers, or animated indicators — allowing us to identify which format feels most natural and least intrusive to users.

      The second sketch illustrates the <strong>intervention functionality</strong>. The image shows four variations of interventions designed to subtly interrupt prolonged scrolling and encourage mindful breaks. Two main strategies are explored: one where the Instagram feed gradually turns <strong>monochrome</strong> after extended use, and another where the <strong>brightness of the feed is reduced</strong>. Each variation tests how visual cues and changes in display affect user awareness and promote calmer phone usage.

    <h3 class="mb-4">Prototype Models</h3>
    
    <h4>Prototype 1</h4>
    <p>
      Prototype 1 represents a manual control model in which users can directly configure the system’s interventions through a dedicated Controls window. The interface is structured around user autonomy, allowing participants to explore and manage several core features, including Time Limits, Usage and Friends, Profile, and Settings. Within the Controls section, users can activate one intervention at a time, such as Monochrome, Slow Scroll, Brightness Reduction, or Monitor Time, to observe its immediate effect on their scrolling experience. This version emphasizes transparency and customization, enabling users to consciously select, combine, or disable interventions according to their preferences. The experience relies on deliberate interaction, giving participants a sense of agency over how and when calm technology cues are introduced.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Prototype 2</h4>
    <p>
      Prototype 2 presents a context sensitive adaptive model that operates without a Controls window. Instead of manual activation, the system automatically adjusts interventions based on real time user behavior. As the session progresses, the app triggers dynamic contextual events such as a visible clock indicating elapsed time, gradual desaturation of color (monochromy), or slight slowdowns in scrolling to gently draw the user’s attention to prolonged use. These cues evolve as engagement continues, providing ambient self regulating feedback rather than requiring explicit user configuration. Prototype 2 therefore embodies a hands off approach, integrating calm technology principles more deeply by allowing the system itself to sense and respond to usage patterns. It prioritizes subtle awareness and adaptive intervention over direct control, supporting reflection through passive feedback rather than user initiated action.

        <h3>Observer Briefing for both prototypes</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          As an <strong>observer</strong>, your primary responsibility is to quietly watch how participants interact with the app designed to help reduce Instagram screen time. Avoid offering assistance, explanations, or suggestions unless the participant is completely unable to continue.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          During the session, pay close attention to:
          <ul>
            <li>How the participant navigates through the interface to explore features.</li>
            <li>The clarity and intuitiveness of the interface as users attempt to complete key actions like setting limits, reviewing progress, or customizing their experience.</li>
            <li>Visible signs of confusion, hesitation, or frustration, including pauses, repeated actions, or verbal expressions of difficulty, and how the participant chooses to respond to these situations.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Your goal is to gather detailed observations that shed light on the system’s <strong>ease of use, efficiency, engagement</strong>, and ability to handle errors. Specifically, record:
          <ul>
            <li>Any usability challenges the participant encounters.</li>
            <li>The approximate time taken to complete major tasks.</li>
            <li>Behavioral cues and feedback that reflect the participant’s comfort, satisfaction, or frustration.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Please remain neutral and unobtrusive throughout the process. The goal is to observe authentic user behavior and capture insights that will help evaluate the design’s effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.

        <h3>User Introduction for Both Prototypes</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Welcome, and thank you for taking part in our usability testing session. Today, you’ll be testing a low-fidelity prototype of an app designed to help users track and reduce their screen time on Instagram. Your participation will allow us to evaluate how intuitive, motivating, and user-friendly the system is.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          During this session, you’ll be asked to complete a series of short tasks within the app. These tasks include:
          <ul>
            <li>User Log In</li>
            <li>Explore the App</li>
            <li>Set Time Limits</li>
            <li>Enable an Intervention in Controls</li>
            <li>React to Contextual Events</li>
            <li>Check Time Usage</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          The user will not be asked to “Enable an Intervention in Controls” in prototype 2. There are no right or wrong answers or actions; we’re simply interested in understanding how you naturally interact with the app. Please speak your thoughts out loud as you perform each task, sharing anything that feels confusing, frustrating, or enjoyable. Your honest feedback is essential to improving the design and ensuring it effectively supports users in managing their screen time. The session should take around 20 minutes, followed by a short discussion about your experience.

        <h3>User Training Documentation</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Since the goal of this usability test is to evaluate how intuitive, learnable, and user-friendly the prototype design is, participants were not provided with any prior instructions, manuals, or demonstrations on how to use the app or its features. Given that participants already possess familiarity with Instagram and its interface, they were expected to rely on this prior experience to navigate and complete tasks within the prototype. Before starting the test, participants were only briefed on the specific benchmark tasks they were required to perform, such as viewing their screen-time statistics, setting time limits, enabling reminders, and customizing their experience, but no further operational details were shared. This approach ensures that user performance reflects the prototype’s natural ease of use and intuitiveness, allowing us to accurately assess how effectively the design supports users in managing and reducing their Instagram screen time without explicit instruction.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Test Tasks</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          The usability study focuses on evaluating how effectively the app supports users in tracking and managing their digital habits across multiple platforms. Participants will complete a series of tasks designed to explore the system’s main features, from basic navigation to setting limits and responding to interventions. Each task is designed to test different features of the system, capturing both the ease of use and the quality of insights gained.
        </p>

            Participants set limits for daily usage to see how easily the app allows control over digital habits.
            <br><strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Navigate to the “Time Limits” section.</li>
              <li>Set daily or app-specific scrolling limits.</li>
              <li>Confirm that limits are saved correctly.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Enable an Intervention in Controls (Prototype 1 only)</strong><br>
            Participants test interventions designed to influence usage behavior. For this experiment, they will activate one intervention at a time.
            <br><strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Open the “Controls” window.</li>
              <li>Select a single intervention: Monochrome, Slow Scroll, Brightness, or Monitor Time.</li>
              <li>Verify that the selected intervention is active while others remain off.</li>
              <li>Observe the effect of the intervention on app usage.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>React to Contextual Events (Prototype 2 only)</strong><br>
            Participants experience dynamic changes in the app interface that simulate real-world interruptions.
            <br><strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>A clock reminds the user of elapsed time.</li>
              <li>Screen monochromy gradually decreases.</li>
              <li>Scrolling becomes slower or slightly laggy.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Check Time Usage</strong><br>
            Participants review daily app usage statistics to evaluate how clearly information is presented.

  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold mb-4">Summary of Results</h2>
    <p>For this usability study, three participants were recruited to evaluate two prototypes of our app designed to prevent doomscrolling. Each participant completed a pre-test questionnaire, engaged in guided tasks with the prototypes, and participated in interviews both before and after the testing session. The pre-test provided context on participants’ social media habits, prior attempts to limit usage, and awareness of the emotional and behavioral impact of extended scrolling.</p>

    <p>Participants first filled out a pre-test questionnaire about their social media habits and self-awareness regarding doomscrolling. Then, they explored the app and completed benchmark tasks, such as logging in, setting time limits, enabling interventions, and reviewing usage data. Each participant interacted with Prototype 1 (which included the “Controls” window for manual selection of interventions) and Prototype 2 (which introduced timed contextual events). Finally, participants answered reflection questions about clarity, comfort, intuitiveness, and overall experience.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Participant Profiles and Pre-Test Insights:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Participant 1:</strong> This graduate student uses social media multiple times per day, primarily YouTube and Reddit, spending approximately 3–4 hours daily. She had previously tried limiting her usage with Digital Wellbeing. She reported feeling regretful after long scrolling sessions and noted decreased energy and screen fatigue as negative impacts.</li>
      <li><strong>Participant 2:</strong> This participant uses Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and Snapchat multiple times per day, spending over 5 hours daily on social media. She had previously tried limiting usage by deleting apps. She reported feeling relaxed after scrolling, but acknowledged procrastination and reduced presence with her son as negative consequences.</li>
      <li><strong>Participant 3:</strong> This undergraduate participant primarily uses Instagram and TikTok for 1–2 hours daily and had previously set time limits on her phone. She reported feeling restless after scrolling, with procrastination and reduced productivity as the main negative impacts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Participants were asked questions at the beginning and end of the session. The initial interview gathered context on their social media habits, prior methods for limiting usage, and awareness of doomscrolling. The final interview focused on their experience with the prototypes, including ease of use, clarity of interventions, navigation, and overall satisfaction. These interviews helped contextualize task performance and provided qualitative insights into preferences and perceived utility of the prototypes.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Interview and Test</h4>
    <p>All participants were able to log in successfully. The login process was smooth and intuitive, with each participant taking slightly different approaches but reaching the main interface without difficulty. The exploration of the app was generally straightforward for all participants. Most found the layout intuitive, although a few required additional time to navigate and become familiar with the available windows and icons.</p>

    <p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> Participant 1 approached the tasks calmly and methodically. She explored the interface at her own pace and was able to set app time limits easily, navigating directly to the correct window. The only notable challenge was during the “Controls” task in Prototype 1, where she initially entered “Settings” instead of “Controls.” Once she located the right section, she completed all four intervention activations successfully. She found the process interesting and appreciated being able to test each intervention separately. Overall, she described the app as intuitive and well-structured once she understood the menu organization.</p>

    <p><strong>Participant 2:</strong> The second participant was highly exploratory, testing almost every feature to understand its purpose. Although she found the overall navigation engaging, she experienced some confusion distinguishing the home screen, the dashboard, and the friends section, as well as mistaking the message icon for the progress tracker. Time limits were set easily, but the “Controls” section again caused difficulty; she initially navigated to “Settings,” assuming sound or notification controls were related. Once she understood the intervention's purpose, she responded very positively. She particularly liked the Monochrome mode, describing it as “boring, like old shows,” which she felt could effectively discourage her from scrolling. She related Monitor Time to a timer function and noted that while she liked it, her child might not enjoy it. Regarding Slow Scroll, she found it effective but mentioned it could frustrate users with less patience. She also suggested combining Brightness with warmer tones, as she found it similar to Monochrome. The “Friends” section stood out as a motivating element, encouraging social accountability and goal-sharing. In Prototype 2, she appreciated how contextual changes occurred automatically, stating that having both approaches could benefit different types of users.</p>

    <p><strong>Participant 3:</strong> The third participant navigated easily through the app and understood the Time Limits and Friends features clearly. She successfully set limits and explored her activity data without assistance. Her only concern was whether she would need to ask for permission to add friends, expressing that she preferred autonomy in this area. In Prototype 1, she located and enabled the Controls smoothly, finding the interventions straightforward to manage. She liked the Monochrome mode and described Slow Scroll as “progressive,” appreciating how it gradually affected her scrolling behavior. She viewed the Brightness intervention as similar in purpose and suggested it worked well as a subtle reminder. In Prototype 2, she enjoyed the contextual transitions, particularly how the screen feedback acted as a passive yet constant reminder of time spent.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Post-Test Interview</h4>
    <p>After completing the usability tasks, participants answered a short post-test interview designed to assess their perceptions of clarity, comfort, intrusiveness, and overall usability of both prototypes.</p>

    <p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> She reported that most interventions were clear and understandable and preferred Prototype 1 for its structure and manual control. She found the Timer particularly effective for increasing awareness of her scrolling behavior. While she thought the Control icon could be more intuitive, she described the dashboard as useful and comfortable to use long-term. She suggested having default intervention settings and displaying numerical indicators for time limits. Her most effective interventions were Timer and Monochrome, while Slow Scroll was “useful but slightly annoying.”</p>

    <p><strong>Participant 2:</strong> She found the interventions clear and effective, noting that the app made her more aware of her scrolling time. She described some moments as “annoying but helpful,” since they encouraged her to take breaks. She liked the interface layout and described it as “cool,” though the time tracker was confusing at first. She considered the app effective both for herself and her son, suggesting an option to combine Brightness, Blue Light, and Warm Tone controls. Her preferred interventions were Monochrome, Slow Scroll, and Timer.</p>

    <p><strong>Participant 3:</strong> She described the interventions as clear, inclusive, and self-explanatory. She preferred Prototype 1 because it allowed her to choose which interventions to enable. She confirmed that the app made her more aware of her scrolling behavior and found it non-intrusive. Although she personally wouldn’t use the friends feature, she appreciated its motivational potential. She recommended grouping Home and Controls for faster access and adding an option to choose between “time up” or “time down.” She found the interface visually appealing and said she would “definitely try” the app. Her favorite interventions were Monochrome and Monitor Time.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Benchmarks and General Findings</h4>
    <p>The benchmark tasks were designed to evaluate the usability of the prototypes in relation to the system’s core objectives: tracking screen time, setting personalized goals, managing reminders, activating behavioral interventions, and reflecting on progress. Each task represented a key interaction that users would need to perform in real-world scenarios to effectively monitor and regulate their social media usage.</p>

	<h4 class="mt-4">Overall Performance</h4>
	<p>Across all three participants, the login and onboarding processes were consistently described as straightforward and intuitive. Each user successfully accessed the main interface on their first attempt, demonstrating that the entry flow was effectively designed and required minimal cognitive effort.
	</p><p>The exploration phase of both prototypes was generally positive. Participants expressed that the layout and structure felt familiar, resembling other wellness or tracking applications. However, minor confusion arose when interpreting certain icons or distinguishing between similar windows, such as “Home,” “Dashboard,” and “Friends.” While these issues did not prevent task completion, they occasionally increased exploration time, indicating that icon clarity and visual hierarchy could be further refined.
</p>


<!-- Task-Specific Observations Section Start -->
<section id="task-observations" class="py-5 bg-light">
  <div class="container">
    <h3 class="mb-4">Task-Specific Observations</h3>
    <p>
      The task of setting and adjusting screen-time limits was completed successfully by all participants without any assistance. Each participant described this task as clear, direct, and efficient. Being able to define personalized usage thresholds was perceived as both practical and empowering, reinforcing the app’s purpose as a self-regulation tool. Participants appreciated that they could immediately see and modify their time limits, which helped them feel a sense of control over their digital habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enabling and customizing interventions, such as Monochrome Mode, Slow Scroll, Brightness Adjustment, and Timer, proved to be the most challenging aspect of the app. Initially, all participants navigated to the “Settings” menu instead of the “Controls” section, indicating that the distinction between system settings and behavioral controls was not immediately intuitive. Once the correct section was located, however, participants successfully understood how to activate and combine the different interventions. They expressed appreciation for the app’s flexibility, highlighting that being able to choose or combine behavioral nudges made the experience more engaging and personalized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viewing and reflecting on usage data was completed effectively by all participants. They found the dashboard and summaries helpful in understanding their scrolling patterns. The visual representation of daily usage, comparisons, and trends encouraged reflection on habits and allowed participants to identify areas where they could moderate their screen time. This task reinforced the value of immediate feedback as part of self-monitoring and goal-setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Responding to gradual behavior cues, such as the automatic interventions in Prototype 2, was also positively received. Participants noted that features like Slow Scroll or subtle changes in screen brightness acted as gentle reminders to pause or slow down scrolling. These cues were effective without being intrusive, and participants appreciated the ability to engage with them at their own pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, during the end-of-session reflection, participants expressed that the app had successfully increased their awareness of their doomscrolling behavior. They felt comfortable using the system and appreciated the clarity of the interface, with minor exceptions related to icon interpretation and layout grouping. The combination of interactive tasks and self-reflective features contributed to a meaningful user experience, highlighting the app’s potential to encourage more mindful engagement with social media.

    <h4 class="mt-4">Perceived Usefulness and Preferences</h4>
    <p>Among the interventions tested, Monochrome Mode, Slow Scroll, and Timer received particularly positive feedback.  Participants described these features as effective in making them more conscious of time spent scrolling and in reducing the appeal of visually stimulating content. Some also suggested integrating brightness adjustments or warm color tones as complementary mechanisms for visual fatigue reduction.
</p><p>Prototype 1 was generally preferred due to its clarity, structure, and sense of control, which gave users a stronger feeling of agency in selecting interventions. However, Prototype 2 was appreciated for its automatic and contextual adjustments, which participants felt could better support users seeking a more passive form of self-regulation. Several participants noted that having both options, manual and automated, would address a wider range of user preferences and personalities.

    <p><em>Observations: In Prototype 2, all interventions were pre-applied, and automatic behavior cues were helpful.</em></p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Conclusions</h4>
    <p>Overall, both prototypes successfully achieved their core objective: increasing user awareness of doomscrolling behavior and encouraging more mindful engagement with social media. The tasks aligned with participants’ expectations of wellness-oriented applications, and the app’s interventions were viewed as meaningful and adaptable.</p>

    <p>Minor usability issues were identified, primarily related to icon interpretation, layout grouping, and the discoverability of the Controls section. Addressing these points could significantly enhance navigation efficiency and overall satisfaction. Participants emphasized motivation, self-awareness, and personalization as the most valuable dimensions of the app experience, suggesting that future iterations should continue to strengthen these psychological and emotional aspects alongside usability improvements.</p>
